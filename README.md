# An Informal Guide to Web Publications


## Introduction

What is a web publication? The spec says:

> A Web Publication is a discoverable and identifiable collection of resources. Information about the Web Publication is expressed in a machine-readable document called a manifest, which is what enables user agents to understand the bounds of the Web Publication and the connection between its resources.

Two things make web publications different from the “ordinary” web we know and love. First, a web publication may consist of multiple resources that form a logical whole. Moby-Dick might consist of 136 HTML files in a specified order, but it’s still a single work. So searching should search all 136 chapters.

More importantly, users have a set of expectations about how such content should be presented in order to make it easy to read and understand. Users need to personalize the presentation, using the font and font size that make it easiest for them to read. They want it to be easy to go to the next chapter without interrupting the reading experience by hunting for a link to click. They might need a high- or low-contrast version of the content. They want to read while offline.

Thus the goal of web publications is to make these features ("affordances") available to readers. We hope that someday browsers will provide these features, but in the meantime we have to use scripting. That's OK, because we'll learn a lot from trying, and that will help the spec get better.

## Goals

 
- Provide a mechanism for defining a collection of web resources as a publication

 - The resources may be images (comics/manga) or audio files (audiobooks)
 
- Provide a mechanism for ascribing descriptive metadata to a collection of web resources.

- Provide a mechanism for defining an ordering of the resources in a publication

- Describe the affordances needed for reading publications on the web

 
 
## Non-goals

 - Issues of layout, such as pagination or achieving effects similar to EPUB's fixed layout. 
 
 - Extending the DOM to include collections of document elements 
 
 - DRM
 
## Basic design

A web publication must have an <i>entry page</i>, which the HTML document returned by the URL of the publication. This page must have either a link to the manifest (`<link rel="publication" href="manifest.json">`, or an [embedded](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/327) manifest. 

A “manifest” is a list of the passengers or cargo on a ship. For web publications, a manifest lists the constituents of the publication—all the HTML files, stylesheets, images, scripts, etc.—needed to create the whole. It further describes the sequence of primary resources, so that we know that chapter-02.html comes after chapter-01.html. In EPUB we called this list the "spine"; for web publications it's now the `readingOrder`. 

The manifest is also the natural location for metadata that applies to the whole publication, rather than just one of the constituents. The metadata vocabulary is based on schema.org; the entire manifest is serialized as JSON-LD. 


## Example Manifest

Here's a simple example of a web publication manifest, for a tiny version of *Moby-Dick* with only a few HTML files:

```json
{
    "@context": ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
    "type": "Book",
    "url": "https://publisher.example.org/mobydick",
    "author": "Herman Melville",
    "dateModified": "2018-02-10T17:00:00Z",

    "readingOrder": [
        "html/title.html",
        "html/copyright.html",
        "html/introduction.html",
        "html/epigraph.html",
        "html/c001.html",
        "html/c002.html",
        "html/c003.html",
        "html/c004.html",
        "html/c005.html",
        "html/c006.html"
    ],

    "resources": [
        "css/mobydick.css",
        {
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "rel": "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp#cover-page",
            "url": "images/cover.jpg",
            "encodingFormat": "image/jpeg"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "html/toc.html",
            "rel": "contents"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneral.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralBol.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralBolIta.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        },{
            "type": "PublicationLink",
            "url": "fonts/STIXGeneralItalic.otf",
            "encodingFormat": "font/otf"
        }
    ]
}

```

Note that `readingOrder` defines the sequence of primary resources that form the publication. `resources` enumerates all the other resources that are required to render the publication. 

## Design choices

The unanswered question:

> is the goal of this group to make a new packaging format for specialist book reading software and devices, or is it to obtain first class support for missing book-related features in the web platform as a whole?



The key questions are [1] identifying the "bounds" of the publication, [2] defining the ordering of the primary resources, and [3] figuring out how to express metadata for the publication as a whole. 

How you answer those questions depends to some extent on other choices. We say a web publication must have a URL that returns an HTML document with a link to the manifest. 



### 1. What's part of the publication?

- The [Web Application Manifest spec](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) uses `scope` to define the extent of a web application. 

- Every component of an EPUB publication must be listed in an XML package file.

- Web sites do not explicitly define their boundaries.

- XML sometimes uses the idea of *transclusion*, where the contents of other documents can be incorporated into a parent document based on hypertext references. This concept can also be realized in HTML using iframes, HTML imports, custom elements, etc. The working group has shown no interest in this approach. 

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Moby-Dick</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <web-publication>
      <iframe src="c001.html">
      <iframe src="c002.html">
      <iframe src="c003.html">
    </web-publication>
  </body>
</html>

```

The web publications spec has essentially adopted EPUB's approach, with an explicit list of resources. Anything that is not part of the `resources` or `readingOrder` manifest members is considered to be outside the web publication. 

### 2. Sequence of primary resources

- HTML can express ordering of resources via `rel=prev` and `rel=next`, but these do not have UI support from the browsers (with notably rare exceptions).

- HTML can also express an ordered list of links with the `nav` element. 

- Transclusion can also define an ordering of the transcluded components. 

- EPUB uses the `spine` element in the XML package file to determine a primary reading order.

Once again, web publications use an explicit list outside of the content itself, via the `readingOrder` member of the manifest. 

### 3. Metadata

- EPUB includes metadata in the XML package file

- There are many ways of embedding metadata in individual HTML files

- Metadata about a web application can be expressed in the web application manifest file. 

- With transclusion, one could define metadata in the parent file to apply to the whole.

Web publication metadata is expressed in the manifest, using a vocabulary largely taken from schema.org. 




### Relationship to Web Application Manifest

The Web Publication Manifest appears to be very similar to the Web Application Manifest. Both are JSON files that are linked to from HTML, and provide metadata about a composite resource. Several [arguments](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/wiki/Options-for-Processing-a-Manifest) [have](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32) been made against using WAM.

1. WP use cases are orthogonal to those of WAM. Nothing is stopping a creator of a web publication from also using a web application manifest, if the publication author desires for the publication to be installable, etc. 

2. The web application manifest spec is not designed to be extensible. 

3. Web publications are fundamentally different from web apps, as the goal is for the user agent to provide the user interface. 


But note that the [TAG has spoken](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/32#issuecomment-362273649) in favor of using WAM. 



## The User Experience

Reading something that takes a day or a week rather than a few minutes influences what sort of user experience works for the reader. We have a formal [use cases and requirements document](https://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/) in addition to lots of actual experience from ebook reading systems. Browsers have implemented "reading modes" to address some of these requirements. 


#### Navigating

- Easily move through the entire publication in order. In most ebook reading systems, a single gesture moves between pages and between sections. 

- The table(s) of contents should always be available. It should be possible to quickly navigate anywhere in the publication. 

- Retaining state. If I leave a publication while reading, I should be able to easily return to where I left off. Extra credit for implementing this across devices. 

- I may have hundreds or thousands of publications. How can they be organized so I can find them? 


#### Personalization

- ability to change font, font size, background color

- night mode

#### Offline

- Web publications should function while offline (Service Workers)

#### Annotation

- it should be possible to bookmark, highlight, and annotate web publications

- it should be possible to craft a URL to point anywhere within a publication

#### Search

- it should be possible to search the entire publication
